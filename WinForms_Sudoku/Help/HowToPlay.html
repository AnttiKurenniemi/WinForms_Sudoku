    <h1>Simple Sudoku - How to play</h1>

    <p><strong><i>Tip 1:</i></strong> You can keep this help page open while you play. Drag the window so that it doesn't
        cover the game window.</p>

    <p><strong><i>Tip 2:</i></strong> This help is only shown once automatically, when you start the game for the first time.
        If you wish to see this help later, you can find it from the &quot;File...&quot; menu button on the main game
        window.</p>

    <h2>Game basics</h2>

    <p><strong><i>Note:</i></strong> This is only a very brief explanation of the game. There are many, many places on
        the web where you can find out more about Sudoku.</p>

    <p>Sudoku is a puzzle game in which you must place numbers from 1 to 9, in each cell of a 9 x 9 grid. Numbers must be
        placed so that each vertical and each horizontal row of 9 numbers contains each digit from 1 to 9, exactly once. Also
        each 3 x 3 cell sub-grid must contain each digit exactly once.</p>

    <p>Some numbers are given to start the game, as seed numbers. You must start deducing other numbers based on the seed
        numbers. For example, if the first row has numbers 1, 2 and 3 on it in any cell, you know that those numbers can not
        be placed in any other cell on the first row.</p>

    <p>The game ends - is solved - when all cells have numbers and none of them conflicts with any other number.</p>

    <h2>The game window</h2>

    <img src="./main_window_1.png" alt="Game main window" class="screenshot"/>

    <p>The main window looks like this. It has the game grid on the left, a bunch of function buttons on the right and
        a status display at the bottom right.</p>

    <p>The game board is where you place numbers. You can move the selection (the blue cell) with the keyboard cursor
        keys, or by clicking on any cell with the mouse. To place a number, simply press on that number on the
        keyboard - or, if you have already selected a cell with a number (all other cells with the same number will be
        shown with the number in blue color, like number 4 in the image), you can place that same number to a cell by
        double-clicking on where you want to place the number. To delete a number, press the Backspace or Delete key
        on your keyboard, or press 0 (zero).<br />

        You can place numbers on empty cells and on cells that already have some other number, if that number was placed
        by you and not given as a seed number. Simply select a cell with an existing (black) number and place a new one
        on top of it.</p>

    <p>The function buttons on the right are:<br /><br />

        <strong>File...</strong> button opens a file menu where you can save and load games, and open this help page.<br /><br />

        <strong>Set random preset</strong> sets a predefined game layout, randomised so that you should never get the same
        board again. These are more or less tested layouts that should be somewhat interesting to play.<br /><br />

        <strong>Set random layout</strong> generates a completely random game
        which may or may not be interesting - it is always possible to solve, but tends to be rather easy.<br /><br />

        <strong>Give a hint</strong> will solve one cell if it is possible for the game engine. The hint cell will have a
        green font color. You can ask for as many hints as you need, as long as the game can determine a new cell value.<br /><br />

        <strong>Undo move</strong> lets you undo any moves you have made, for as long as you have played the game.<br /><br />

        <strong>Solve all</strong> will use the game engine to solve the whole board. You can use this also to solve any
        puzzles you find from other sources: just place the initial numbers on an empty board and have the engine solve
        it. Note that the engine only uses straight forward deduction logic, not brute force, so it won't be able to solve
        any and all boards out there.<br /><br />

        <strong>Check if solvable</strong> button will attempt to solve the game and display an overlay with the result.
        You can use this to check the game every now and then, to see if you have placed numbers that make it impossible
        to solve the game.</p>

    <h2>Status display</h2>

    <p>The status display on the bottom right shows elapsed game time, moves used and cells slved. It also has a grid of
        numbers showing in a more visual way, how many numbers of each digit have been solved.</p>

    <h2>Colors explained</h2>

    <p>During the game, you will see numbers in different colors and cells with different background colors. These are:<br /><br />

        <strong>Gray numbers</strong> in cells indicate fixed numbers, numbers that came with the original layout. You can't
        undo or delete those, or place your own numbers on top of them.<br /><br />

        <strong>Black numbers</strong> are numbers placed by you, that are not in conflict with any other numbers in the same
        row, column or block.<br /><br />

        <strong>Blue numbers</strong> indicate all cells that have the same digit as the cell that is currently selected. It
        does not mean anything, it is just a visual aid for you when playing.<br /><br />

        <strong>Green numbers</strong> are numbers that have been completely solved. For example in the screenshot shown here,
        number 1 (one) has been solved - nine cells with number 1 have been placed.<br /><br />

        <strong>Red numbers</strong> indicate an error, a conflict with the same number in another cell on the same row, column
        or block. All conflicting numbers are shown, so it will be very easy to spot the error. You can then <strong>Undo</strong>
        your last move, or place another number on top of one of the conflicting numbers, or delete one of the conflicting
        numbers.<br /><br />

        <strong>Blue background</strong> on a cell indicates the currently selected cell.<br /><br />

        <strong>Green background</strong> indicates a row or column, or a 3x3 block of cells that have been completely solved.</p>

    <h2>Show possible values</h2>

    <p>At the very bottom-right corner of the main window is a checkbox labeled <strong>Show possible values</strong>.
        Selecting that checkbox makes the game draw all possible values to cells that have not been assigned a number, as
        small numbers. This can be used to give you a hint in a difficult situation, or to gain an understanding of how
        the game sees the board.</p>

    <h2>The end</h2>

    <p>That's it, no more blah blah - go play the game!</p>
